# Udacity Capstone Project - Casting Agency

The Casting Agency is a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. As an Executive Producer within the company I have decided to create a system to simplify and streamline my process.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to your backend directory.

```sh
cd starter
```

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

Activate your virtual environment if you havent by running the below.

```sh
virtualenv --no-site-packages env
source env/bin/activate
```

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

#### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

- [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) iis an extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic.

## Database Setup

With Postgres running, run

```sh
dropdb casting_agency
createdb casting_agency
psql casting_agency < casting_agency.psql
```

```sh
flask db upgrade
```

## Running the server

From within the `./starter` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

Each time you open a new terminal session, run:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Note: All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines.](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## API Documentation

- Base URL: Currently hosted at *heroku link*, when run locally it is hosted at the default `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- Authentication: Auth0 username-password/google authentication is being used. All routes excluding the `api/token` route need a token

### Roles

Casting Assistant/Anyone:

- Can view actors and movies

Casting Director:

- All permissions a Casting Assistant has and…
- Add or delete an actor from the database
- Modify actors or movies

Executive Producer:

- All permissions a Casting Director has and…
- Add or delete a movie from the database

Token needed for GET requests can be gotten from the access token returned in the redirect url after visiting link below.
CLIENT_ID is located in the env_file
`https://fsndenv.auth0.com/authorize?audience=casting-agency&response_type=token&client_id={{CLIENT_ID}}&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

#### POST `/api/token`

- Returns jwt token for accessing API endpoints
- Request body should contain pre-registered username, password

N.B: I will supply already registered username and password that have been assigned roles, for easy testing.

Sample Request for casting director with role already assigned with `casting@gmail.com`

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{
  "username": "casting@gmail.com",
  "password": "Casting@1",
}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/token
```

```json

  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": "delete:actors post:actors",
}
```
